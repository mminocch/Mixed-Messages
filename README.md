# Mixed Messages

## Project Description \

The objective of this project is to build a message generator program. Every time the user runs the program, they should ge ta new, randomized output.

I am creating and completing this project as a part of the Codecademy Backend Developer Program. I plan to have my messages be related to random numbers on a 20 sided die.

## How To Use \

Ideally, click a button and you're off!

## Collaboration \

Solo raid.

## License \
